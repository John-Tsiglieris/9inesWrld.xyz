    <p>Hello, my apologies for anyone who stumbled upon this website by accident. You deserve better. You're probably wondering that this place is all about, and well...
       I want to turn this into a forum dedicated to discussion of.....stuff. The stuff that this place will encompass is completely undecided, I kind of just wanted to do
      this. Development is slow and but steady, I should probably get working on an actual thread creation system - but that beiung said, the login system is kinda crap.
    I even got started on a "live" chat system before I even got the main component of a forum going! But it's also shit. I'll configure
    that to work as a comment system on these blogs, you guys will see that soon.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>I know there's stuff out there to help me get a framework for this but you know what. Fuck that. Screw jsChan, TinyBoard. I wanna build something from scratch. I
      wanna get away from the stale chan styled imageboard. I'm not really sure where I;m taking this, but I envision a board that has similar choices of anonymity that you
    get on 4chan, but with the option to make an account and post under a handle. I'll probably make a lot of features inaccessible to non members though. Maybe I'll add add
    a degree of secrecy to the website, with chatrooms that only certain people can access, or take inspiration from old school BBS's. I'm just ranting at this point, I just
    wanted to get things on the page.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>Have you ever seen art that really grinds your gears, check out my friend M4xx1's tumblr page. It's cringe as hell and I'll probably get him to post on here when the
      functionality is there. But take a look I guess. </p>
