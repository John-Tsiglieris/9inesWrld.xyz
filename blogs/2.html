    <p>Hello, whom ever is there. I wanna keep this update brief and lay out the plan for the next couple weeks. As you may notice at the time of reading you will see dysfunctional buttons for
    general discussion and posting threads. I plan on adding functionality — albiet bare — to these features so I can officially call this a <i>forum</i>. Another thing is user profiles, equipped with
    profile pictures and user status. Fancy right? And then comes the multimedia support and yada yada... I'll get that done sometime. I also need to make sure my databases are solid before I transfer them
     live. A lot is going on behind the scenes. I hope I can get it up soon.</p>
